# HADES - AI-Powered Cyber Threat Detection

## Project Description

**HADES** (Higher Assistance for Defense and Emergency Security) is an AI-powered cyber threat detection system that uses machine learning to identify and respond to security risks in real-time. By analyzing network traffic, system logs, and user behavior, HADES helps detect and mitigate emerging cyber threats, providing faster and more intelligent responses to potential security breaches.
## Features

- **Real-time Threat Detection**: Identifies suspicious activities and attacks as they occur.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Recognizes patterns of behavior that deviate from the norm.
- **Automated Incident Response**: Helps security teams by providing immediate alerts and suggested actions.
- **Scalability**: Adaptable to various environments, from small networks to enterprise-level infrastructures.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Trains on historical attack data to continuously improve threat detection accuracy.
